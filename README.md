# Inorganic_Ion_Predictor

Inorganic ion predictor classifies the transmembrane transport proteins based on the specific inorganic ion(s) which they transport. Leveraging Prot-BERT language model, each input protein sequence is predicted to one of 12 specific classes: ''proton'', ''calcium(2+)'', ''potassium(1+)'', ''chloride'', ''sodium(1+)'', ''sulfate'', ''zinc(2+)'', ''ammonium'', ''nitrate'', ''iron(2+)'', ''phosphate ion'', and ''copper(1+)''.
